# 🎸 Skullcapz Dev Shop – Fan Feature Drops

## 🎓 About This Project

This activity is part of the **Global Career Accelerator – Coding for Web** course.  
You’ll be using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AI tools** to build real interactive features for a fictional band’s website.

In this **Dev Shop simulation**, your team will create beginner-friendly features for **Skullcapz**, a fictional heavy metal band.  
You’ll apply JavaScript fundamentals like functions, DOM manipulation, and logic — while learning how to use **AI to scaffold, debug, and refine** your code.

## 🧠 What You’ll Be Doing

In this lab, you'll simulate working in a **Dev Shop**.  
Your job? Use beginner JavaScript skills to build one of six interactive features for the band **Skullcapz**.

You’ll practice:
- Writing and editing simple JavaScript functions
- Updating the page using the DOM
- Prompting AI (like ChatGPT or Copilot) to scaffold and debug your feature

This site includes:

- ✅ A randomized **Setlist Generator**
- ⏳ A dynamic **Countdown Timer** to Skullcapz’s first show
- 🛠️ Team-assigned features that you'll build using JavaScript and AI

---

## 🧪 Getting Started

Open this project in **GitHub Codespaces** or your own code editor. 

### Files to Edit

- `index.html` — where you’ll add buttons, text, and containers
- `style.css` — optional styles for polish
- `script.js` — where you’ll write your JavaScript

> 💡 Use the HTML comment tags (`<!-- -->`) to find where to add your team’s code!

## ⚙️ How This Repo Is Organized

| Folder/File | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `index.html` | Base layout with placeholder sections for each feature |
| `style.css` | Starter styles to keep things clean and readable |
| `script.js` | Some demo code (Setlist + Timer) and pre-written scaffolds for each team task |
| `assets/` | Contains logo and concert images you can reuse if helpful |

## 🛠 Team Feature Options

You’ll build **one** of these features with your team:

| **Task Name** | **What It Does** |

| 🏆 VIP Ticket Winner Generator | Randomly picks and displays a winner from a list of emails |
| 🎶 Fan Favorite Showdown | Lets fans vote on their favorite song with a simple counter |
| 📍 Tour Date Spotlight | Click a city to reveal the venue and date |
| 🛣 On the Road Again | Automatically shows the next upcoming tour date |
| ✉️ Entry Checkpoint | Checks if the user input is a valid email address |

## 💡 Tips for Working with AI

- Start with plain English: “How can I build a button that…”
- Ask follow-ups if you don’t understand the output
- Test often in the browser — even if the AI code looks “right”
- Ask for **HTML and JavaScript** together in one prompt.
- If AI gives too much, copy just the parts you need.

Happy coding! 🤘
